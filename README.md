# PytorchLearn
## Foreword
The desire to learn deep learning has been around for a long time. However, 
what really motivated me to create this repository was something that happened yesterday.

In fact, since the beginning of the second semester of my freshman year, 
I had developed a strong interest in computer vision, 
motivated by a desire to combine my hobby with my studies. 
To my delight, the opportunity presented itself. 
My instructor, Limeng, sent out a message in the notification group 
that the research team, which started in the sophomore year, was hiring. 
I knew in that instant that I could not afford to miss this opportunity again.

## LearnPlan
